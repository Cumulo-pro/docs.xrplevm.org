# XRPL EVM Devnet Faucet

To explore and interact with the **XRPL EVM Sidechain**, you will need test XRP ($XRP) to cover transaction fees and execute smart contracts. The XRPL EVM provides two methods to obtain test $XRP: the **Chains.tools Faucet** and the older **XLS38d bridge**.

## Using the Faucet

The fastest way to acquire $XRP is by using the Chains.tools Faucet. This tool allows you to request small amounts of $XRP to begin testing and building on the XRPL EVM Sidechain.

### Steps to Use the Faucet

1. **Visit the Faucet Website:**
   Go to the XRPL EVM Devnet Chains.tools [Faucet](https://chains.tools/faucet/xrplevm).

2. **Enter Your Wallet Address:**
   - Copy your wallet address from an EVM-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask.
   - Paste the wallet address into the faucet’s input field.

3. **Complete the CAPTCHA:**
   Verify you are not a robot by completing the CAPTCHA.

4. **Request $XRP:**
   - Click the button to request $XRP.
   - Each wallet can request up to **10 XRP every 60 minutes**.

5. **Check Your Wallet:**
   - Open your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) connected to the XRPL EVM Sidechain.
   - Confirm that the $XRP has been credited.

### Important Details
- **Network Fees:** The faucet is specifically designed for testing purposes on the XRPL EVM Devnet.
- **TVL Information:** The faucet page also displays the **Total Value Locked (TVL)** on the XRPL EVM network and statistics on requests and donations.

If you would like to support the faucet, you can donate to help other developers access test $XRP for their projects.

## Using the XLS38d Bridge

Alternatively, you can obtain $XRP by transferring assets from the XRPL Devnet using the older **XLS38d bridge**. This method allows you to bridge XRP from the XRPL Devnet to the XRPL EVM Sidechain.

> For detailed instructions on how to use the XLS38d bridge, see [Using the Bridge](./using-the-bridge.md).

### Key Notes About the XLS38d Bridge
- The XLS38d bridge operates exclusively on the XRPL Devnet and is not compatible with the XRPL Mainnet.
- The bridge will eventually be deprecated in favor of the **Axelar-powered bridge**, which is currently under development.
- Transactions on the bridge are for **development purposes only** and should not be used for production or Mainnet environments.

## Start Building on the XRPL EVM Sidechain

Once you have acquired $XRP through the faucet or the XLS38d bridge, you are ready to begin deploying and interacting with Solidity-based smart contracts on the XRPL EVM Sidechain. For further guidance, explore the following resources:

- **Getting Started with MetaMask:** Learn how to connect your wallet to the XRPL EVM network.
- **Using the Bridge:** Step-by-step instructions for transferring assets between XRPL and the XRPL EVM Sidechain.
- **XRPL EVM Explorer:** View transaction details and network activity at [https://explorer.xrplevm.org](https://explorer.xrplevm.org).

Leverage the XRPL EVM’s speed, low transaction costs, and Ethereum compatibility to create innovative decentralized applications (dApps).
