# Using the Bridge


The XRPL EVM bridge allows you to move assets between the XRPL and its EVM sidechain. This is useful for utilizing XRP tokens on dApps that run on the EVM chain.

### How to Transfer Assets

1. **Access the Bridge UI**
   - Visit [bridge.devnet.xrpl.org](https://bridge.devnet.xrpl.org).

2. **Connect Your Wallets**
   - **XRPL Wallet:** Use the Faucet wallet option to generate an XRPL wallet.
   - **MetaMask Wallet:** Connect your MetaMask wallet to the XRPL EVM bridge.

3. **Select Tokens to Transfer**
   - Choose XRP or another token to transfer.
   - Enter the amount to bridge.

4. **Sign Transactions**
   - Confirm the transaction in both wallets.

5. **Monitor Transaction Progress**
   - The bridge UI will display the progress. Once complete, the tokens will appear in your XRPL EVM wallet.

**Comparison:** On Ethereum, bridges like Arbitrum or Polygon Bridge often take longer due to higher block times. XRPL EVM benefits from faster block finality.
