# Install MetaMask

MetaMask is a browser extension and wallet for accessing decentralized applications (dApps) on EVM-compatible chains. It allows users to interact with blockchain networks directly from their browser, making it an essential tool for interacting with the XRPL EVM sidechain.

## Attention

The XRPL EVM-compatible sidechain implementation is a **proof of concept** extension to the XRP Ledger protocol and is intended for development purposes only. It is currently connected to the **XRPL Devnet** and not the production mainnet. **Do not send transactions in Mainnet.**

This guide explains how to install MetaMask. For configuring it for XRPL EVM, refer to the "Connect MetaMask to the XRPL EVM Sidechain" guide.

## Notes for Developers

MetaMask injects the XRPL EVM sidechain Web3 API into every website's JavaScript context. This allows dApps to interact seamlessly with the XRPL EVM blockchain.

If you encounter any issues, ensure that you are on the latest version of MetaMask. Additionally, remember that this is a **Devnet environment**, so it should only be used for testing and development purposes.

For configuring MetaMask to connect to XRPL EVM, see the "Connect MetaMask to the XRPL EVM Sidechain" documentation.
