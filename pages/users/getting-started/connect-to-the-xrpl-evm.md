# Connect MetaMask to the XRPL EVM

## Attention

The XRPL EVM-compatible sidechain implementation is a **proof of concept** extension to the XRP Ledger protocol and is intended for development purposes only. It is currently connected to the **XRPL Devnet** and not the production mainnet. **Do not send transactions in Mainnet.**

This guide will walk you through configuring MetaMask to connect to the XRPL EVM.

## Notes for Testing and Development

- **Devnet Environment Only:**
  The XRPL EVM Sidechain is still in its Devnet phase. Use it exclusively for testing and development purposes.

- **Future Updates:**
  The Testnet launch is planned for the second half of January, which will offer a more stable environment for broader testing.

- **Transaction Fees:**
  Current transaction fees are around 4¢, but future adjustments aim to reduce this to approximately 1¢.

If you encounter any issues, ensure that the RPC URL, Chain ID, and other network details are entered correctly. For further assistance, refer to the XRPL EVM documentation or [support channels](https://discord.gg/xrplevm).
