# Introduction

The **XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain** is a groundbreaking blockchain ecosystem that extends the capabilities of the XRP Ledger by integrating programmability and smart contract functionality. This empowers developers to utilize XRPL's speed and cost-efficiency alongside the XRPL Sidechain Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) extensive programmability, harnessed via Solidity smart contracts.

## Key Features of XRPL EVM

- **Low Fees:** Transaction costs are significantly lower compared to Ethereum and other EVM chains, making it highly cost-effective.
- **Fast Transactions:** With block finalization times of just under 4 seconds, users and developers experience near-instant transaction processing.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** The Axelar network and XRPL bridge enable seamless asset transfers between XRPL and other blockchain ecosystems.
- **Development-Focused Environment:** Currently in the Devnet stage, the XRPL EVM will soon transition to a Testnet environment, paving the way for broader testing and eventual mainnet deployment.

## Tech Stack

The XRPL EVM leverages a robust technological foundation:

- **Cosmos SDK:** Provides a modular framework for building the blockchain, offering high performance and flexibility.
- **Evmos:** Brings Ethereum compatibility to the Cosmos ecosystem, allowing the deployment of EVM-compatible smart contracts while benefiting from Cosmos's scalable and efficiencient consensus layer.
- **CometBFT (Tendermint):** Ensures (BFT) Byzantine fault tolerance and high throughput, making the network resilient and performant.

## Interacting with Smart Contracts

One unique feature of XRPL EVM is the ability to interact with smart contracts directly from the XRPL Mainnet using **Axelar General Message Passing (GMP)**. This functionality allows users and developers to initiate smart contract executions on the XRPL EVM from the native XRPL, bridging the gap between the two ecosystems and enabling cross-chain dApp functionalities.

## Current Status and Updates

The XRPL EVM is in its **Devnet stage** but is rapidly progressing towards a **Testnet launch** planned for the second half of January. Key technical and operational milestones include:

- **Chain Upgrades:** Recent upgrades to v4 and v5 have brought the latest versions of the Cosmos SDK and Evmos, resolving validator sync issues and enhancing network stability.
- **Explorer Enhancements:** Both Cosmos and EVM explorers are being updated to improve functionality and provide better insights into network activity.
- **Validator Onboarding:** Efforts are underway to add high-quality validators to ensure geographic decentralization and robust network infrastructure.
- **Network Parameters:** Ongoing adjustments to transaction fees aim to maintain competitive pricing against networks like Binance and Polygon.

## Heads-Up for New Users

For users new to blockchain technology or the XRPL EVM ecosystem, here are some important considerations:

- **Development Environment:** The current network is in devnet stage and intended for development purposes only.
- **Future-Proofing:** The Devnet will be archived for minimal usage, with a new Testnet becoming the primary testing environment.
- **Transaction Fees:** While current fees are around 4¢ per transaction, future adjustments will bring them closer to 1¢, aligning with competitive networks and XRPL ethos.

This introduction highlights the innovative approach of XRPL EVM to bridge the gap between XRPL and Ethereum-like ecosystems. It combines the best of both worlds, ensuring a seamless, cost-effective, and developer-friendly blockchain environment.
