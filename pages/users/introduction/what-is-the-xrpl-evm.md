# What is the XRPL EVM

The **XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Sidechain** is an innovative blockchain ecosystem that extends the capabilities of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) by introducing Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility. This enables developers to build and deploy Solidity-based smart contracts on the XRPL ecosystem, combining the cost-efficiency and speed of XRPL with the programmability of Ethereum.

## Key Features of the XRPL EVM

### 1. **Ethereum Compatibility**

- **Smart Contracts:** Fully supports Solidity, Ethereum's native smart contract language.
- **Tool Integration:** Developers can use familiar Ethereum tools such as Remix, Truffle, and MetaMask to interact with the XRPL EVM.
- **EVM Equivalence:** Enables seamless migration of Ethereum-based applications to the XRPL EVM Sidechain with minimal changes.

### 2. **Low Costs and High Performance**

- **Transaction Fees:** Significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum, making the XRPL EVM more accessible for developers and users.
- **Fast Transactions:** Block finalization occurs in under 4 seconds, ensuring quick transaction confirmation.

### 3. **Cross-Chain Interoperability**

- **Axelar Network Integration:** Facilitates cross-chain asset transfers and messaging between the XRPL, XRPL EVM, and other blockchains.
- **Bridge Functionality:** Use the XRPL EVM bridge to move assets between the XRP Ledger and the EVM sidechain.

### 4. **Decentralized Development Environment**

- **Built on Cosmos SDK:** Provides a modular and scalable framework for blockchain development.
- **Powered by Evmos:** Brings Ethereum compatibility to the Cosmos ecosystem, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Uses CometBFT (Tendermint), ensuring Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and high throughput.

## Why Use the XRPL EVM?

The XRPL EVM bridges the gap between two powerful blockchain ecosystems: the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This combination creates unique opportunities for developers and users:

### 1. **Cost-Efficient dApp Development**

The XRPL's low transaction fees reduce the cost of deploying and interacting with smart contracts, making it an attractive choice for developers and startups building decentralized applications (dApps).

**Example:** A decentralized exchange (DEX) can be deployed on XRPL EVM with lower operational costs compared to Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.

### 2. **Global Payments Meets Programmability**

The XRPL is known for its robust global payment infrastructure. Adding EVM compatibility enables developers to programmatically manage those payments through smart contracts, enabling:

- Automated settlements.
- DeFi applications like lending, staking, and yield farming.
- Tokenized cross-border transactions.

**Example:** A lending protocol on XRPL EVM can leverage XRPL's payment infrastructure for faster and cheaper loan settlements.

### 3. **Cross-Chain Asset Mobility**

With Axelar and the XRPL EVM bridge, assets can move seamlessly between the XRPL and other blockchain ecosystems, creating interoperability for:

- Cross-chain DeFi platforms.
- Multi-chain NFT marketplaces.

**Example:** An NFT marketplace built on XRPL EVM can support assets from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and XRPL.

### 4. **Enhanced User and Developer Experience**

- Developers familiar with Ethereum can transition to XRPL EVM without learning new tools or languages.
- Users benefit from XRPL's speed and low fees while interacting with Ethereum-compatible dApps.

## Current Status

The XRPL EVM is currently in its **Devnet stage**, with a **Testnet launch planned for the second half of January**. This phased rollout ensures thorough testing and validation before the mainnet deployment.

### Recent Updates:

- **Chain Upgrades:** Improved network stability and performance with the latest Cosmos SDK and Evmos updates.
- **Explorer Enhancements:** Upgrades to both Cosmos and EVM explorers for better network visibility.
- **Validator Onboarding:** Efforts to decentralize the network further by adding high-quality validators from diverse geographies.
- **Transaction Fee Optimization:** Plans to adjust fees to remain competitive with networks like Binance and Polygon (~1¢ per transaction).
