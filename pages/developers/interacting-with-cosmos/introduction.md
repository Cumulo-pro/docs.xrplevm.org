# Introduction

The XRPL EVM is built on top of the [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network/appchains/), an open-source toolkit for building blockchains. The Cosmos SDK framework provides a powerful foundation with several key benefits:

* **Modularity**: The Cosmos SDK employs a modular architecture, allowing developers to choose from predefined modules or create custom modules for various blockchain functionalities. This flexibility speeds up development while accommodating unique use cases.
* **Interoperability**: Custom blockchains built using the Cosmos SDK can natively interoperate with other blockchains through the [IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)](https://ibc.cosmos.network/) protocol. Refer to the [Using IBC page]() for a deeper dive into this feature.
* **Security**: The Cosmos SDK abstracts and secures low-level blockchain mechanics, enabling developers to focus on building secure and efficient interactions between modules.
* **Built-in interfaces**: With the Cosmos SDK, users can easily query network and application state information through built-in interfaces that interact directly with blockchain stores and modules. For more details see the [Using the API page]().
