{% admonition type="info" name="Attention" %}

Currently, relaying messages between chains (XRPL and XRPL EVM Sidechain) to Axelar is supported for XRP transactions through the portal. To relay messages or transactions, it is necessary to do so manually.

In the future, manual relaying of messages will not be required.
